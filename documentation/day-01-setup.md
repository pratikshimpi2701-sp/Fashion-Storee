## 🐛 Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "node is not recognized"
**Solution:** Node.js not installed properly. Reinstall and restart terminal.

**Solution:** Another app is using port 3000. Close it or use a different port:
```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Error: "Permission denied"
**Solution (Mac/Linux):** Add `sudo` before the command:
```bash
sudo npm install -g create-next-app
```

### Error: Installation is very slow
